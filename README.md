# Full Stack Developer
I am a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience, specializing in creating scalable back-end systems using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, while building dynamic front-end interfaces with ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. My expertise includes developing efficient RESTful APIs, integrating OAuth-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for secure authentication, and managing application state with tools like Redux and React Router. With a strong background in Agile (SCRUM) methodologies and Test-Driven Development (TDD), I prioritize high-quality code and robust unit testing. I also have hands-on experience in automating deployment through CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. My proficiency in enterprise-level integrations with Spring and Apache Camel enables me to optimize application performance and stability, delivering seamless user experiences.
